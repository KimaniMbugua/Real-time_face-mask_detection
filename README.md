Real-Time Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python


Real-Time Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Python. This project, completed during my final year, focuses on creating an accurate mask detection system. Leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision, I implemented a CNN architecture to analyze live video streams and instantly identify individuals wearing masks and those without. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and integration with real-time video feeds. Through this work, I aimed to contribute to public health by enabling efficient mask monitoring in various settings. #DeepLearning #ComputerVision #CNN #Python
